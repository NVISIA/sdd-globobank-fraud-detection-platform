## Business Capability Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Business scenarios should be PRIORITIZED as capability journeys ordered by business value.
  Each scenario must be INDEPENDENTLY CONTRACTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable business capability that delivers value to the platform.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each scenario, where P1 is the most critical business outcome.
  Think of each scenario as a standalone business contract that can be:
  - Specified independently as a business requirement
  - Validated independently against business outcomes
  - Contracted independently with implementing teams
  - Measured independently for business value
-->
