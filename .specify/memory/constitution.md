# GloboBank Fraud Detection Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All fraud detection systems MUST implement zero-trust security architecture with defense-in-depth strategies. Every component requires authentication, authorization, and continuous validation. All data transmissions must be encrypted, and all access must be logged and monitored. Security controls are embedded at every layer: network, application, data, and endpoint.

**Rationale**: Financial fraud detection systems handle highly sensitive customer data and financial transactions, requiring the highest security standards to protect against both external threats and internal misuse.

### II. Real-Time Processing and Response

Fraud detection systems MUST process transactions in real-time with sub-200ms response times for critical decision points. Event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka enables immediate fraud scoring and response. All fraud alerts must trigger automated containment actions within seconds.

**Rationale**: Fraudulent transactions can cause immediate financial harm; delayed detection allows fraudsters to complete attacks and escape with stolen funds.

### III. AI/ML Model Governance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All machine learning models MUST undergo rigorous validation, bias testing, and regulatory compliance review before production deployment. Model performance, drift, and fairness metrics must be continuously monitored. Models require retraining schedules and performance thresholds for automatic deactivation.

**Rationale**: AI-driven fraud detection decisions directly impact customers and must meet financial services regulations for fairness, transparency, and accuracy.

### IV. Test-Driven Development with Risk Scenarios

TDD mandatory for all fraud detection logic: Risk scenarios written → Business approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Comprehensive test coverage includes fraud pattern simulations, edge cases, and regulatory compliance scenarios. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced with fraud-specific test data.

**Rationale**: Fraud detection systems protect financial assets; untested code could miss fraud patterns or generate false positives that harm customers.

### V. Microservices Architecture with Event Streaming

Every fraud detection capability starts as an independently deployable microservice. Services communicate via Apache Kafka for real-time event processing. Domain-driven design with clear service boundaries aligned to fraud detection business capabilities.

**Rationale**: Fraud detection requires rapid scaling, independent deployment of detection algorithms, and real-time data processing across multiple channels.

### VI. Observability and Compliance Monitoring

Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting for all fraud detection activities. Structured logging with correlation IDs for transaction tracing. Regulatory audit trails for all fraud decisions and model predictions. Performance metrics tracked against SLAs.

**Rationale**: Financial regulators require complete audit trails for fraud detection decisions, and operational teams need visibility to maintain system performance.

### VII. Regulatory Compliance by Design

All fraud detection features MUST comply with BSA/AML, FFIEC guidelines, Fair Credit Reporting Act, and applicable state/federal regulations. Compliance validation occurs at every development phase. Legal and risk team approval required for new detection algorithms.

**Rationale**: Financial institutions face severe penalties for non-compliant fraud detection practices; compliance must be embedded in the system design rather than added afterward.

## Data Governance Framework

### Data Quality Management (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All fraud detection data MUST meet stringent quality standards with automated validation pipelines. Data quality monitoring includes completeness (>99%), accuracy (>99.5%), consistency checks, and timeliness validation. Data quality issues trigger automated alerts and remediation workflows.

**Rationale**: Poor data quality leads to false fraud alerts and missed fraud patterns, directly impacting customer experience and financial losses.

All ML models undergo three-tier validation: Statistical validation (accuracy >95%, precision >90%, recall >85%), business validation (cost-benefit analysis, stakeholder review), and regulatory validation (bias testing, compliance review, audit documentation). Models require quarterly performance reviews and annual comprehensive validation.
