## Overview

This repository serves as the **Platform Specification Repository (PSR)** for GloboBank's Fraud Detection Platform. It contains business capability specifications that define the contractual interface between business requirements and platform implementation teams.

### Purpose

The PSR approach enables:

- **Business-First Design**: Specifications focus on business outcomes and value delivery
- **Contract-Driven Development**: Clear contracts between business capabilities and implementation teams
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in BSA/AML, FFIEC, and banking regulation adherence
- **Platform Scalability**: Specifications designed for enterprise-scale fraud detection
- **Quality Assurance**: Validated specifications with comprehensive business requirement checklists

## Business Capabilities

### Active Specifications

| Capability | Version | Status | Business Impact | Branch |
|------------|---------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| [Transaction Risk Scoring](#transaction-risk-scoring) | v1.0 | ✅ Validated | High - Fraud Prevention | `001-transaction-risk-scoring` |

### Transaction Risk Scoring

**Business Capability**: Real-time fraud detection for financial transactions using known fraudulent credit card identification.

- **Specification**: [`specs/001-transaction-risk-scoring/spec.md`](specs/001-transaction-risk-scoring/spec.md)
- **Domain**: Core Fraud Detection
- **Business Owner**: Chief Risk Officer
- **Regulatory Requirements**: BSA/AML transaction monitoring, FFIEC fraud risk management
- **Key Business Outcomes**:
  - 100% detection accuracy for known fraudulent credit cards
  - <200ms real-time transaction scoring
  - Zero false positives for legitimate transactions
  - Complete regulatory audit trail compliance

**Business Contract Summary**:

- Scores transactions using transaction ID and credit card number
- Assigns 1000 risk points for known fraudulent cards, 0 points for legitimate cards
- Marks transactions fraudulent when score exceeds 1000 points
- Maintains complete audit trail for regulatory compliance

## Getting Started

### For Business Stakeholders

1. **Review Existing Capabilities**: Browse the [Business Capabilities](#business-capabilities) section
2. **Understand Business Contracts**: Each specification defines clear business outcomes and success criteria
3. **Validate Requirements**: Use the quality checklists to ensure specifications meet business needs

### For Product Teams

1. **Access Specifications**: Navigate to `specs/` directory for detailed business capability specifications
2. **Review Business Contracts**: Understand the business requirements and success criteria
3. **Check Dependencies**: Review platform integration requirements and external dependencies

### For Development Teams

1. **Study Business Contracts**: Understand the business outcomes before technical design
2. **Follow Constitutional Requirements**: Adhere to security, compliance, and performance requirements
3. **Implement Against Contracts**: Build solutions that deliver the specified business outcomes

## SpecKit Workflow

This repository uses the SpecKit methodology for specification management:

### Creating New Specifications

```bash
# Create a new business capability specification
/speckit.specify [business capability description]

# Example:
/speckit.specify Create a capability to support risk scoring for transactions to determine if they are fraudulent
```

### Specification Lifecycle

1. **Specify** (`/speckit.specify`): Create business capability specification from business requirements
2. **Clarify** (`/speckit.clarify`): Resolve any business requirement ambiguities
3. **Plan** (`/speckit.plan`): Generate technical architecture and implementation plan
4. **Implement**: Build the capability according to the business contract
5. **Validate**: Ensure implementation meets business success criteria

## Regulatory Compliance

### Banking Regulations

All specifications in this repository are designed to meet:

- **BSA/AML**: Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering requirements
- **FFIEC**: Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council guidelines
- **FCRA**: Fair Credit Reporting Act standards for fraud decisions
- **State Banking Regulations**: Applicable state-level banking and fraud prevention requirements

### Compliance Features

- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging and audit trail for all fraud decisions
- **Explainable Decisions**: All fraud scoring decisions include clear business rationale
- **Data Governance**: PCI DSS compliance for credit card data handling
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Support for Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) generation

## Platform Architecture Principles

### Constitutional Requirements

All capabilities must adhere to the platform constitution:

#### Security-First Development

- Zero-trust authentication for all API endpoints
- TLS 1.3 encryption for data transmission
- Comprehensive audit logging with correlation IDs
- PCI DSS compliance for payment card data

#### Real-Time Processing

- <200ms response time for transaction decisions
- Event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka
- Auto-scaling with Kubernetes HPA
- 99.99% availability requirements

#### AI/ML Model Governance

- Bias testing before production deployment
- Continuous model performance monitoring
- Model drift detection and retraining workflows
- Explainable AI for regulatory compliance

#### Data Governance

- >99% data completeness and >99.5% accuracy standards
- Data classification (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)
- GDPR Article 25 privacy by design
- End-to-end data lineage tracking

## Quality Assurance

### Specification Validation

Each specification includes a comprehensive quality checklist:

- **Business Content Quality**: Ensures business focus without implementation details
- **Business Requirement Completeness**: Validates measurable and unambiguous requirements
- **Platform Contract Readiness**: Confirms clear acceptance criteria and integration points
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Verifies adherence to security, performance, and regulatory requirements

### Business Success Criteria

All specifications define measurable business outcomes:

- **Quantitative Metrics**: Specific targets (accuracy %, response time, volume capacity)
- **Qualitative Measures**: Customer satisfaction, regulatory compliance, operational efficiency
- **Business Validation**: Criteria that can be verified through business outcomes

## Integration Patterns

### Platform Capabilities

Specifications define integration with other platform capabilities:

- **Event-Driven Integration**: Real-time data streaming for transaction processing
- **REST API Integration**: Synchronous data access for fraud investigations
- **Batch Processing**: Regulatory reporting and compliance data export

- **Feature Branches**: Individual capability development following pattern `###-capability-name`
- **Specification Branches**: Business requirement development with quality validation

### Specification Review Process

1. **Business Review**: Product owners validate business requirements and outcomes
2. **Compliance Review**: Compliance team ensures regulatory requirement coverage
3. **Architecture Review**: Technical teams review platform integration and dependencies
4. **Quality Validation**: Automated checklist validation ensures specification completeness
