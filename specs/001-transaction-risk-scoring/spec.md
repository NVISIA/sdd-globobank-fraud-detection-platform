# Business Capability Specification: Transaction Risk Scoring

**Specification Branch**: `001-transaction-risk-scoring`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Version**: v1.0
**Domain**: Fraud Detection Platform
**Input**: User description: "Create a capability to support risk scoring for transactions to determine if they are fraudulent. The transaction data should be minimal for this first spec creation. Only use the transaction ID and the credit card number. The transaction should be processed through a single rule. The rule should check if the credit card number is in the list of known fraudulent credit cards. The transaction should be scored with 1000 points if it's considered fraudulent. The transaction should be marked fraudulent if the score is more than 1000 points."

## Specification Metadata *(mandatory)*

- **Capability Area**: Transaction Risk Scoring
- **Business Impact**: High - Directly prevents fraudulent transaction losses and protects customer accounts
- **Regulatory Requirements**: BSA/AML transaction monitoring, FFIEC fraud risk management
- **Integration Points**: Transaction processing systems, fraud case management, customer notification systems
- **Contract Version**: v1.0

## Business Context *(mandatory)*

This capability provides real-time risk scoring for financial transactions to identify potentially fraudulent activity before transaction completion. The business capability focuses on protecting GloboBank customers from fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives that could disrupt legitimate customer activity.

The capability serves as the foundational fraud detection mechanism that enables GloboBank to meet regulatory requirements for transaction monitoring while providing immediate protection against known fraudulent payment instruments. This capability is essential for maintaining customer trust and regulatory compliance in the digital banking environment.

Business assumptions made for this specification:

- Known fraudulent credit card numbers are maintained in a centralized fraud management system
- Transaction processing requires immediate risk assessment (sub-second response)
- Initial implementation focuses on basic rule-based detection before advancing to ML models
- False positive mitigation will be addressed in future capability enhancements

## Stakeholders *(mandatory)*

- **Business Owner**: Chief Risk Officer - accountable for fraud loss reduction and regulatory compliance
- **Product Owner**: Fraud Prevention Product Manager - responsible for fraud detection requirements and customer impact
- **Compliance Lead**: BSA/AML Compliance Officer - ensures regulatory transaction monitoring compliance
- **Technical Lead**: Fraud Platform Architect - responsible for real-time processing architecture
- **Risk Owner**: Fraud Risk Manager - accountable for fraud detection accuracy and business risk management

## Constitutional Compliance *(mandatory)*

### Security-First Development Compliance

All transaction data and fraud scoring decisions are protected through zero-trust architecture with encrypted data transmission, authenticated API access, and comprehensive audit logging. Credit card data handling follows PCI DSS requirements with tokenization and minimal data exposure.

### Real-Time Processing Compliance

Transaction risk scoring operates within strict latency requirements (<200ms) to support real-time transaction authorization decisions. The capability integrates with streaming transaction data to provide immediate fraud assessment.

### AI/ML Model Governance Compliance

Initial implementation uses rule-based fraud detection with transparent decision logic. Future ML model integration will follow model governance requirements including bias testing, explainability, and regulatory audit capabilities.

### Platform Regulatory Compliance

Capability meets BSA/AML requirements for transaction monitoring by maintaining complete audit trails of fraud scoring decisions, generating suspicious activity alerts, and supporting regulatory reporting for fraud investigations.

## Business Capability Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Business Scenario 1 - Real-Time Fraud Detection for Known Bad Cards (Priority: P1)

When a transaction is submitted using a credit card number that appears on the known fraudulent cards list, the system immediately assigns a high risk score and marks the transaction as fraudulent, enabling instant protective action.

**Why this priority**: This scenario provides immediate protection against the most obvious fraud cases and delivers measurable fraud loss reduction with minimal false positives.

**Business Contract**: For every transaction processed, if the credit card number matches the known fraudulent cards list, the transaction receives a risk score of 1000 points and is marked fraudulent within 200ms, enabling real-time transaction blocking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a transaction with credit card number on the known fraudulent cards list, **When** risk scoring is performed, **Then** the transaction receives 1000 risk points and fraudulent status
2. **Given** a transaction with credit card number not on the known fraudulent cards list, **When** risk scoring is performed, **Then** the transaction receives 0 risk points and non-fraudulent status
3. **Given** multiple transactions processed simultaneously, **When** risk scoring is performed, **Then** each transaction is scored independently within 200ms response time

---

### Business Scenario 2 - Audit Trail for Regulatory Compliance (Priority: P2)

Every risk scoring decision is logged with complete audit information to support regulatory examinations and fraud investigations, ensuring BSA/AML compliance and enabling fraud pattern analysis.

**Why this priority**: Regulatory compliance is mandatory for banking operations and audit trails enable fraud investigation and pattern identification for future prevention improvements.

**Business Contract**: For every transaction scored, the system maintains a complete audit record including transaction ID, credit card number (tokenized), risk score, decision timestamp, and decision rationale, accessible for regulatory reporting and fraud investigations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a transaction is risk scored, **When** the scoring decision is made, **Then** a complete audit record is created with all required compliance data
2. **Given** a fraud investigation request, **When** audit data is retrieved, **Then** complete scoring history is available for the specified transaction or time period
3. **Given** regulatory reporting requirements, **When** audit data is exported, **Then** all fraud scoring decisions are available in the required format

---

### Edge Cases and Exception Scenarios

- What happens when the known fraudulent cards list is temporarily unavailable? (Capability defaults to 0 risk score and logs the exception for manual review)
- How does the capability handle malformed or invalid credit card numbers? (Invalid formats receive 0 risk score with validation error logging)
- What are the fallback business processes when scoring latency exceeds 200ms? (Transaction proceeds with warning alert and manual review flag)
