## Business Context *(mandatory)*

The Fraud Detection Platform User Interface provides a minimal, secure entry point for fraud detection operations. This capability enables authorized users to submit transaction verification requests and receive real-time fraud risk assessments. The interface serves as the primary customer touchpoint for the fraud detection platform, displaying GloboBank branding and providing immediate feedback on transaction risk status.

This initial implementation focuses on core functionality without complex security layers, establishing the foundation for future security enhancements. The interface bridges business users with the underlying fraud detection engine, translating complex risk algorithms into clear, actionable business decisions.

## Stakeholders *(mandatory)*

- **Business Owner**: Fraud Operations Manager - accountable for fraud detection business outcomes
- **Product Owner**: Digital Banking Product Manager - responsible for requirements and prioritization  
- **Compliance Lead**: Regulatory Compliance Officer - ensures regulatory compliance
- **Technical Lead**: Frontend Architecture Lead - responsible for technical architecture
- **Risk Owner**: Chief Risk Officer - accountable for risk management

## Constitutional Compliance *(mandatory)*

### Security-First Development Compliance

Initial implementation will have minimal security controls with plans for future zero-trust architecture implementation. Current security measures include basic input validation and secure communication protocols.

### Real-Time Processing Compliance

User interface must provide real-time fraud assessment results within 200ms response time constraint to enable immediate business decisions.

### AI/ML Model Governance Compliance

Interface will display AI-driven fraud detection results with transparency in decision presentation. Future implementations will include model explainability features for regulatory compliance.

### Platform Regulatory Compliance

Interface must maintain audit trails for all fraud detection requests and responses to meet BSA/AML documentation requirements. User actions will be logged for regulatory review.

## Business Capability Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Business Scenario 1 - Transaction Fraud Verification (Priority: P1)

Authorized users can submit transaction details and receive immediate fraud risk assessment to make critical business decisions about transaction approval.

**Why this priority**: Core business function enabling immediate fraud detection and financial loss prevention.

**Business Contract**: Deliver real-time fraud risk assessment capability that processes transaction verification requests and returns clear fraud status within 200ms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid transaction ID and credit card number, **When** user submits fraud verification request, **Then** system returns clear fraud risk status (fraudulent/not fraudulent)
2. **Given** a known fraudulent credit card number, **When** user submits verification request, **Then** system identifies and reports the transaction as fraudulent
3. **Given** system is processing request, **When** fraud assessment is complete, **Then** user receives immediate visual feedback on transaction risk status

---

### Business Scenario 2 - GloboBank Brand Experience (Priority: P2)

Users experience consistent GloboBank branding while accessing fraud detection capabilities, reinforcing brand trust and professional service delivery.

**Why this priority**: Brand consistency builds customer confidence in fraud detection services and maintains professional corporate identity.

**Business Contract**: Provide branded user interface that displays GloboBank visual identity and creates professional user experience for fraud detection operations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses fraud detection interface, **When** page loads, **Then** GloboBank brand banner is prominently displayed
2. **Given** user interacts with fraud detection form, **When** using interface features, **Then** all elements maintain consistent GloboBank branding

---

### Business Scenario 3 - Simple Transaction Input Processing (Priority: P3)

Users can efficiently input transaction verification data through a streamlined interface that minimizes data entry errors and processing time.

**Why this priority**: Operational efficiency in fraud detection processes directly impacts response time and user satisfaction.

**Business Contract**: Provide intuitive data entry interface that accepts transaction ID and credit card number with validation to ensure data quality for fraud assessment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user needs to verify transaction, **When** accessing input form, **Then** form accepts transaction ID as UUID format and credit card number
2. **Given** user submits invalid data format, **When** form validation occurs, **Then** system provides clear error messaging for data correction
3. **Given** user completes valid form submission, **When** processing request, **Then** system provides confirmation of successful submission

### Edge Cases and Exception Scenarios

- What happens when the fraud detection backend service is unavailable during transaction verification?
- How does the interface handle malformed transaction IDs or invalid credit card number formats?
- What are the fallback business processes when network connectivity issues prevent real-time fraud assessment?
